## Project Description:

Sports cars have long been admired for their speed, design, and exclusivity. But what factors determine their often high price tags? Beyond their appearance and brand reputation, specific measurable features play a key role in shaping their value. How do factors like mileage and year of manufacture influence prices? Which features are the most important? Which manufacturers dominate the luxury market, and which offer more budget-friendly options?

This project explores data from Kaggleâ€™s Sports Car Price Dataset and additional information gathered from CarMax. By analyzing variables such as engine size, horsepower, acceleration, mileage, make, and year, this project uncovers patterns and relationships that impact the pricing of sports cars. The goal is to provide insights into the luxury car market, highlight pricing factors, and compare manufacturers across different price ranges.

## Instructions

The repository is broken down into three folders consisting of infromation on the data, report, visuals, and code used in the project. Each folder will have a "README.md" fiel to explain how to navigate the folders.
